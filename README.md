# Welcome to my Deep Learning repo!
- This repository contains all the algorithms that I learnt and implemented from scratch using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), numpy and [Farama Gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

- I have mainly focused on Reinforcement Learning and some ML architechtures.

## Reinforcement Learning:
- [x] Q learning
- [x] DQN
- [x] Temporal Difference
- [x] Reinforce (Policy Gradient technique)
- [x] A3C (Actor-Critic Methods : Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic)
- [x] A2C (Actor-Critic Methods : Advantage Actor Critic)
- [x] DDPG 
- [ ] SAC
- [ ] PPO

## Extra ML Architechtures:
- [x] Basics
- [x] CNN
- [ ] RNN
- [ ] Transfer Learning
- [ ] VAE
- [ ] Transformers
- [ ] Transformer-XL
- [ ] GANs
